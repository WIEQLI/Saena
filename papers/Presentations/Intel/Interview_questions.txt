3 courses, 2 seminars, indivitual meeting with my adviser, team meeting
advanced courses without passing the undergrad courses

Most candidates are good in either Math or programming,
but not in both.
I understand both Math and programming.

Entering new areas and learning new skills.

Why Intel?
A while back I was not sure to get a job in s startup or a big company.
Each has its cons and pros.
Until I watched a couple of videos from the at&t bell lab archive from 80's.
I felt jealous and wanted to be someone like those people, making history.
I think Intel is one of those companies that in a couple of decades people
will have the same feeling watching interviews from Intel team members.
