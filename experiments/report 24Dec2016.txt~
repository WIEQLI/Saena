This is a report, since we have talked:

1- I checked to have the latest version of CombBLAS, and I have done these experments with this one. I also checked the number of processors that I can use for CombBLAS for this version. It still should be a squared number. To make sure that I am using CombBLAS correctly, I checked a sample code for SpMV that they have in the library, and I followed that to do all experiments. I used the same one for previous experiments that I sent you.

2- I generated 47 matrices in homg, both 2D and 3D with different sizes and orders to have a good collection of matrices for tests for now and also for future. I have their info in one text file, including: dimension, grid order and size, matrix size and nnz.

3- I have done the experiments you asked me.
