Name of the mesh, on which the matrix is made in Nektar++:
Helmholtz2D_CG_curved_tri

I have used 4 nodes on Kingspeak for all of them. Number of tasks are 4, 16, 64, since CombBLAS does not work on a number which is not a square. It gives this error:
"This version of the Combinatorial BLAS only works on a square logical processor grid"
