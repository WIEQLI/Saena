Write one :-\/). \href{http://www.boost.org/libs/iterator/doc/iterator_facade.html}{\tt Boost Iterator Facade} makes it really easy.

However, keep in mind that pointers are indeed iterators. If your population data structure guarantees to store elements contiguously, and if you can get a pointer to the first element, you have iterators already. See \hyperlink{trsl__example2_8cpp-example}{trsl\_\-example2.cpp} for an example with a C array.
